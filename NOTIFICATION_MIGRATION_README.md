# Notification Migration: Server-Side to Client-Side

This document explains how to complete the migration from server-side push notifications to client-side notifications using OneSignal.

## What Changed

The notification system has been modified to send push notifications directly from the client (Android app) instead of going through a server-side Cloudflare Worker.

### Before (Server-Side)
- Messages were sent to a Cloudflare Worker at `https://my-app-notification-sender.mashikahamed0.workers.dev`
- The worker handled sending notifications via OneSignal
- Required server infrastructure and maintenance

### After (Client-Side)
- Notifications are sent directly from the Android app to OneSignal's REST API
- No server infrastructure required
- Faster notification delivery
- More control over notification content

## Setup Required

### 1. Get OneSignal REST API Key

1. Log into your OneSignal dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Keys & IDs**
3. Copy the **REST API Key** (not the App ID)

### 2. Update Configuration

Edit `app/src/main/java/com/synapse/social/studioasinc/NotificationConfig.kt`:

```kotlin
// Replace this line:
const val ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY = "YOUR_REST_API_KEY_HERE"

// With your actual REST API key:
const val ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY = "Basic YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**Important**: The REST API key should include "Basic " prefix if that's how OneSignal provides it.

### 3. Verify Notification Channel

The app now creates a dedicated `chat_messages` notification channel in `SynapseApp.java`. This channel is specifically configured for OneSignal notifications with:
- High importance
- Blue light color
- Vibration enabled
- Badge support
- Private lockscreen visibility

## Testing

### 1. Test Configuration

Add this line to your main activity or app initialization to test the configuration:

```java
NotificationHelper.testNotificationConfiguration();
```

This will log all configuration values to help verify setup.

### 2. Test Notifications

1. Build and install the app
2. Send a message to another user
3. Check the logs for:
   - "Client-side notification sent successfully via OneSignal REST API"
   - Or detailed error messages if something fails

### 3. Log Output

The system now provides detailed logging:
- Configuration validation
- Notification payload preparation
- HTTP request details
- Response handling
- Error details with context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OneSignal REST API key not configured"**
   - Update the API key in `NotificationConfig.kt`
   - Ensure the key includes "Basic " prefix if required

2. **"Failed to send notification via OneSignal REST API: 401"**
   - Invalid or expired API key
   - Check the key format (should include "Basic " prefix if required)
   - Verify the key in your OneSignal dashboard

3. **"Failed to send notification via OneSignal REST API: 400"**
   - Invalid notification payload
   - Check that the recipient player ID is valid
   - Verify the notification content structure

4. **"Failed to send notification via OneSignal REST API: 404"**
   - Invalid app ID
   - Verify the OneSignal App ID in `NotificationConfig.kt`
   - Check that the app ID matches your dashboard

5. **"Invalid parameters" errors**
   - Check that sender UID, recipient UID, and player ID are not blank
   - Verify message content is not empty
   - Ensure all required parameters are passed correctly

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Configuration**: Use `NotificationHelper.testNotificationConfiguration()` to verify all settings
2. **Check Logcat**: Look for detailed error messages and request/response logs
3. **Verify OneSignal Dashboard**: Ensure the app ID and API key are correct
4. **Test Player IDs**: Verify that recipient users have valid OneSignal Player IDs
5. **Check Network**: Ensure the device has internet connectivity

### Advanced Debugging

The system now logs:
- Complete notification payloads
- HTTP request URLs and headers
- Response bodies and status codes
- Parameter validation results
- Status check results

## Rollback

If you need to revert to server-side notifications:

1. Restore the original `NotificationHelper.kt` file
2. Ensure your Cloudflare Worker is still running
3. Update the `WORKER_URL` constant if needed

## Benefits of Client-Side Notifications

1. **Faster Delivery**: No server round-trip
2. **Reduced Infrastructure**: No need to maintain server
3. **Better Control**: Direct access to notification content
4. **Cost Savings**: No server hosting costs
5. **Reliability**: No dependency on external server availability
6. **Better Debugging**: Detailed logging and error handling

## Limitations

1. **API Key Exposure**: Key is visible in source code (mitigated with proper obfuscation)
2. **Rate Limiting**: OneSignal may have rate limits for REST API calls
3. **Network Dependency**: Still requires internet connection to send notifications
4. **Client Dependency**: Notifications only work when the sender's app is running

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- API key is stored as a constant in the source code
- This is acceptable for development but not recommended for production

### Production Recommendations
1. **BuildConfig**: Store the API key in `BuildConfig` and obfuscate it
2. **Encrypted Preferences**: Store the key in encrypted SharedPreferences
3. **Remote Config**: Use Firebase Remote Config to fetch the key at runtime
4. **ProGuard**: Ensure the key is obfuscated in release builds

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the implementation thoroughly with the new logging
2. **Short-term**: Implement the security improvements mentioned above
3. **Medium-term**: Monitor notification delivery rates and performance
4. **Long-term**: Set up proper error tracking and analytics
