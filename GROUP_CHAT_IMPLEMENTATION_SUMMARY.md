### 3. **Firebase Integration**
- ✅ Designed Firebase Realtime Database structure:
  ```
  groups/{groupId}/
  group_members/{groupId}/{userId}/

  users/{userId}/
  user_groups/{userId}/{groupId}
  ```
- ✅ Real-time message synchronization

- ✅ Proper security rules and indexing

### 4. **Repository Layer**
- ✅ `GroupRepository` - Group management, member operations
- ✅ `MessageRepository` - Message CRUD, real-time updates, attachments
